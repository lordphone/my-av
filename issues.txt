during setting up carla - step make PythonAPI, cant find include header files in the venv:
# Create the target directory
mkdir -p /home/lordphone/my-av/venvs/carla-venv/include/python3.10

# Link all files (but this won't handle subdirectories)
for file in /usr/include/python3.8/*; do
    ln -s "$file" /home/lordphone/my-av/venvs/carla-venv/include/python3.8/
done

comma2k19 has folder mismanagment

for old openpilot version in comma2k19, when setting up tools, there are dependency issues, need to downgrade dependencies and add them to a hold list.
HOWEVER, by doing this, other packages break? I'm not sure how to use openpilot tools from here. maybe skip it.

hevc videos aren't compatible with ffmpeg's seeking function. had to convert to mp4 files.

installing the right version for cuda/nvidia drivers is important. deb > local

super slow frame reading. probably a cuda or implementation problem.
implemented batch frame reading to combat this^

a rtx 4080 with 12gb vram still cant do much with a 3DCNN, right now 1 batch size, 5 frames at 320 * 160.

turns out my orignal approach is okay for computer simulation, but doesnt work for inference on a comma3x at all, so switching to 2 frame + 5 frame prediction.

shuffling videos and windows are a pain. tried custom sampler, custom batch sampler, what worked is converting my dataset into an iterable one, with custom shuffling.

train script improvements: mixed precision training, multiple workers, GRU memory detachment/zeroing.

steering loss outweighting speed by magnituted of hundreds.
