during setting up carla - step make PythonAPI, cant find include header files in the venv:
# Create the target directory
mkdir -p /home/lordphone/my-av/venvs/carla-venv/include/python3.10

# Link all files (but this won't handle subdirectories)
for file in /usr/include/python3.8/*; do
    ln -s "$file" /home/lordphone/my-av/venvs/carla-venv/include/python3.8/
done
