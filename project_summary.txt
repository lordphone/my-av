Autonomous Vehicle Prediction System - Project Summary
--------------------------------------------------

Core Objective:
- Develop a system to predict future vehicle states (steering and speed) using visual and temporal data.

Technical Stack:
- Model Architecture: CNN (ResNet18) + GRU for temporal modeling
- Input: 
  - Visual: 20-frame sequences (1 second at 20fps)
  - Frame pairs (i, i+2) with 100ms difference, stacked as 6 channels
  - Vehicle state: Current speed and steering angle
- Output: 5 future predictions for both steering (degrees) and speed (m/s) at 100ms intervals (T+100ms to T+500ms)

Data Pipeline:
- Dataset: Comma2k19
- Processing:
  - Non-overlapping 20-frame windows
  - 18 valid frame pairs per window
  - 240x320 pixel images
  - 1200 frames per segment
- Optimizations:
  - Efficient caching (one video segment per DataLoader worker)
  - Proper hidden state management in GRU

Visualization:
- Speed displayed in mph
- Steering angle in degrees
- Turn direction indicators (Left/Right/Straight)
- Works with HEVC video format

This system is designed for predicting near-future vehicle states, suitable for autonomous driving assistance or planning systems.
